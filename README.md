## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project in your local environment.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 20 or higher)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (recommended), npm, or yarn
- A [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) instance (local or cloud)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jjvillarreal/motivational-quotes.git
cd motivational-quotes
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the following variables. You can use the `.env.example` file as a guide if it exists.

```env
# Google Gemini API Key
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_KEY"

# Connection URI for your MongoDB database
MONGO_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017/database_name"

# Secret to protect the cron job endpoint
CRON_SECRET="A_STRONG_AND_RANDOM_SECRET"

# Threads API Credentials
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_THREADS_CLIENT_ID"
CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR_THREADS_CLIENT_SECRET"

# The base URL of your application
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# A random string to use for the OAuth state
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_STATE="A_RANDOM_STRING"

# The email address for support requests
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORT_EMAIL="YOUR_SUPPORT_EMAIL"
```

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### 5. Run Tests

```bash
pnpm test
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Automated Tasks (Cron Job)

The application uses a cron job system to automatically refresh Threads API access tokens, which expire every 60 days.

This process is managed by a **GitHub Action** defined in `.github/workflows/refresh_tokens.yml`.

The GitHub Action runs daily and securely calls the `POST /api/threads/refresh-tokens` endpoint to refresh tokens that are about to expire.

### Production Configuration

For the GitHub Action to work correctly in your repository, you must configure the following **Secrets** in the `Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions` section of your repository:

- `PRODUCTION_URL`: The base URL of your application in production (e.g., `https://my-app.vercel.app`).
- `CRON_SECRET`: The same value you used in your `.env` file.

## üö¢ Deployment

The easiest way to deploy this application is using the [Vercel platform](https://vercel.com/new), from the creators of Next.js.
