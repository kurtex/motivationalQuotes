| Variable | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Your API key for Google Gemini. |
| `MONGODB_URI` | Connection URI for your MongoDB database. |
| `CLIENT_SECRET` | The '''App Secret''' from your Threads application. |
| `CRON_SECRET` | A strong, random secret to protect automated task endpoints. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_ID` | The '''App ID''' from your Threads application. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`| The base URL of your application (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`). |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_STATE` | A random string to prevent CSRF attacks in the OAuth flow. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORT_EMAIL` | Public email for support and data deletion requests. |

### 4. Run the Application

## ‚öôÔ∏è Automated Tasks (Vercel Cron Jobs)

This project relies on Vercel Cron Jobs to handle all automated and scheduled tasks, ensuring the application runs autonomously. The configuration is defined in the `vercel.json` file.

- **Token Refresh**: A cron job runs daily to refresh expiring Threads API tokens, ensuring user sessions remain active.
  - **Endpoint**: `POST /api/threads/refresh-tokens`
  - **Schedule**: Runs once a day (`0 3 * * *`).

- **Scheduled Post Publishing**: A cron job runs every minute to check for and publish any posts that users have scheduled.
  - **Endpoint**: `POST /api/check-scheduled-posts`
  - **Schedule**: Runs every minute (`* * * * *`).

To protect these endpoints, ensure the `CRON_SECRET` environment variable is configured correctly in your Vercel project settings.
